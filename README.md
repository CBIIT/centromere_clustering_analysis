# Centromere Clustering Analysis

This repository accompanies the manuscript **"Simulation and Quantitative Analysis of Spatial Centromere Distribution Patterns"** by Adib Keikhosravi, Krishnendu Guin, Gianluca Pegoraro, and Tom Misteli. It provides tools and scripts for analyzing centromere clustering patterns using high-throughput imaging data and spatial distribution modeling.

## Overview

Centromeres exhibit non-random spatial distribution in the nucleus. Understanding their clustering is critical for studying chromosome behavior, nuclear organization, and associated functional processes. This repository includes:

- **Clustering Metrics**: Tools for analyzing centromere clustering using Ripley's K score, Moran's I, modularity, mean nearest neighbor distance (MNND), and more.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Scripts for generating simulated centromere distribution patterns.
- **Modeling Approaches**: Radial and Gaussian-based models for simulating centromere spatial organization.
- **Visualization Tools**: Methods for generating 2D and 3D visualizations of centromere distributions.
